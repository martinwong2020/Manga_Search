# **Manga Search Information/Database**

## About:
    The project focuses on developing the understanding of react to create a manga database website. Within the project, the tools ulitized are: Jikan Api, React,
    Javascript, Html, CSS. The Website uses multiple fetch request to the ApI Server to retreive the necessry data to display onto the website
    1. One Fetch Request for Top Manga
    2. One Fetch Request for Top Manhua
    3. One fetch request for user search
## Features
 1. Search Bar that displays the top 5 results related to the manga search
 2. Top Manga and Manhua Display/Recommend
 3. The Top Manga and Manhua has a auto slider so it will change display every 5 seconds
 4. A front and back button to change display of the manga display
 5. Information display with the manga

## Challenges 
    1.Getting the top Manga/Manhua to automatically slide after a period of time to show a different top Manga/Manhua.
        Solution: I was able to wait for the promise to be fullfilled before trying to access and display so no NUll Error occurred.
    2.Another last Challenge was getting the fetch Request to work
        Solution: Delaying the api Request per seconde because there is a limit to requesting from the API Server

## Future Plans
 1. Add more Manga's to the front page.
 2. Implement a new page for search to show all result from search.
 3. Use Machine Learning/Cosine Similarity to make manga recommendations
## Instructions
    1. Download the code
    2. Understand you have the necessary libraries and downloads for react.
    3. Run Yarn Start
